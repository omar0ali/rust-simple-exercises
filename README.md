# Rust Simple Exercises

A collection of simple Rust applications for personal use and language practice.

## Deexercises

This repository contains a set of basic Rust programs that perform various simple tasks, including mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), palindrome checks, array shuffling, and more. These programs serve as a personal learning exercise and may be useful for reference in the future.

## Usage

Each program is contained in its own directory and can be compiled and executed independently. You can follow these general steps to run the programs:

1. Navigate to the program's directory.
2. Compile the source code (e.g., `cargo build`).
3. Run the executable (e.g., `./target/debug/program_name`).

Alternatively, you can also set up an alias for convenience. To create an alias, you can add the following line to your `./zshrc` or `./bashrc` file:

```bash
alias program_name='path/to/program_name'
